spring security uses the "basic auth" authorization header of HTTP request to send and receive encrypted information

we need to add dependency of spring-security-starter so that the functions are performed.

by default spring boot does the following activities:
1. generates a custom username and password. username is "user" and password is printed on the run terminal.
all the endpoints are secured with this username and password.
if i directly run the api's again on postman then it will show error 401 unauthorized. hence, we need to give username and password
in the authorization tab of postman. postman automatically creates a header of basic auth and adds "username:password"
with actual values encoded in base 64 form. now all the endpoints are secured. the same can checked by passing user:<password> in base64encode.org website and checking what header is being passed

WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter: it is the class which contains some default configs and provides methods to customized spring security
the code has been added in the config package

various methods present in configure() in config package
1. .authorizeRequests(): tells spring boot to start authorizing the requests
2. .antMatchers("/hello").permitAll(): tells spring boot to match all the endpoints all the ones which are similar to "/hello" must be permitted
3. .anyRequest().authenticated(): this is a more general matcher that tells that all the endpoints that were not matched earlier must be matched rn
and user must provide credentials to access them
4. .and() is the method to join various configs
5. .formLogin(): enables form based authentication. user enters username and password. if matched, then access provided else redirected to default formLogin()

sometimes we authorize the user once and send a session cookie back to the user to validate continuously. helps to create a session.
session steps:
1. session is created when authenticated first time
2. session sends session id with the user in form of cookie
3. session id is validated every time secure url is accessed
4. on logout / session id expiry, it is deleted
5. remember-me: another cookie stores the id for longer duration

now, we want the service to authenticate the password from the hashed password stored in the database.
for this we follow 4 steps:
1. a product entity to represent the product data model
2. a repository UserRepository to interact with MongoDB
3. UserDetailsService interface implementation in a separate Service class which implements this built-in interface
4. a configure method of SecurityConfig in config package handles the auth requests

we need to disable csrf: cross site forgery.
