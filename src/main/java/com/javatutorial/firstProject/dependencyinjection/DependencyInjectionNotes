DEPENDENCY INJECTION
we need to create the object of the following DependencyInjectionDemo. to make sure the spring creates the
object, and we just need to use that object we use the ApplicationContext.
this ApplicationContext object is returned by the line mentioned above of SpringApplication.run()...
hence, we create the ApplicationContext object as shown.

now, for whichever class we need to create the object we need to mention @Component keyword
at the top of that class. this ensures that object is created of that class by the IOC
container and i don't need to anything.

use of AutoWired:
suppose that now i have created a bean in the spring application. now this bean also uses
reference of some other class then i will write @Component on that class and the object will
be created in the IOC container. but how does the Java know that the objects created in the
container are related to each other. this is where Autowired annotation is used. this tells
java that the objects are related to each other and their refs must be passed to them.

use of Primary:
suppose that there is an interface I. this I is implemented by two A and B. now, in the @Component
class we have written I.doWork() (doWork() is declared in I and overriden by A n B). java
doesn't know which object to create A or B.
if i explicity @Component on one of the A or B then java can identify the priority but if both
have @Component or both dont have, then there's a confusion. hence, we have @Primary. this
tells javac that whenever their is confusion of objects like here then prefer the one which has
@Primary annotation. if both have Primary then again error will be thrown.
