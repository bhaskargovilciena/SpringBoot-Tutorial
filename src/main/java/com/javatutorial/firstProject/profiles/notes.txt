by default, we have a profile that is used in development mode. for production mode, we need a separate profile coz we have a different DB for prod and dev.
we need to create 2 more files:
1. application-properties-dev: for dev mode
2. application-properties-prod: for prod mode

by default application-properties will run and there we mention which file to run as in which mode we are using.
