various logging levels:
1. TRACE: more and more info
2. DEBUG: more info
3. INFO: default

logging frameworks: used when creating custom logs
SLF4J (Simple logging facade for java) is the interface which is used to implement logs.
we can create custom implementations of this interface to create our logs

we use the .getLogger() from LoggerFactory to create an instance of logger in the service class.
then we use that logger object and call .info(), .error(), .trace() errors and pass the text as arguments

command used to set the default logging level in debug logs in application.properties: logging.level.root=DEBUG
