there are 2 types of exceptions:
1. in-built: which are present by springboot or java
2. custom: exceptions which are created by the programmer

the sample project has been added from springboot_web dir so that easily things can be demonstrated

we use the annotation of ExceptionHandler to handle all the exceptions. we specify what kinds of exceptions
will be handled by this function and what will be the response entity returned so that our application does not
restart always, and we can gracefully handle all the exceptions

to handle multiple exceptions via the same error handler, we use curly braces, change the argument to type Exception.

org of exception handlers:
we use exception handlers inside a spl package of exceptions, we create a global class called "Global Exception Handler"
we use the annotation of @RestControllerAdvice to handle all the exceptions
