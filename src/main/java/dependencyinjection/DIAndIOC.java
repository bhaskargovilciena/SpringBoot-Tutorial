        dependency injection means that instead of we're creating every object using the new keyword, the spring framework gives the ability to create objects on its own and we can focus on business logic
        2 types of injection -
        1. setter injection - we pass the value / ref of the service in the setter function of the class and the class sets the object
        2. constructor injection - we pass the value / ref of the service in the constructor of the class and the class sets the object

        to run the code using the framework, we need to set the config of the web app
        before we run the code, we need to install and config tomcat to run the web app in system
