to do unit testing, we use JUnit testing package provided by Java. we use the JUnit API testing dependency in the maven repo to include this

we are going to create the controller, model, repository, services just like we created in main package

we use the annotation @Test to declare that this function is a test and @SpringBootTest to tell that this class is used for testing

we use the annotations:
@BeforeEach: to make sure a function runs before every test
@BeforeAll: to make sure a function runs after every test.
similarly, we have @AfterEach, @AfterAll.

we can use the extension of code coverage for java to export our tests report and share it with the team
